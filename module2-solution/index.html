                    The method of loci (loci being Latin for "places") is a strategy of memory enhancement which uses visualizations of familiar spatial environments in order to enhance the recall of information. The method of loci is also known as the memory journey, memory palace, or mind palace technique. The most common type of memory palace involves making a journey through a place you know well, like a building or town. Along that journey there are specific locations that you always visit in the same order.

                    This is a method for creating Mnemonic images for numbers based on things that the numbers remind you of. For example, 02 might be a bicycle, because a bicycle has two wheels. 52 might be a deck of cards, because a deck of cards has 52 cards.

                   "The basic principle is the same as everyone else uses, visualising images at points along a mental route or journey. I don't use the person-action-object ideas of some people, I just have three 'objects' at each point on my route. Some of these objects are people, some are things. I 'see' them arranged from left to right, or top to bottom, and interacting in various ways according to rules I made up as I went along, depending on which objects come together in what order. Each object is made from a combination of two playing cards, or three decimal digits, or ten binary digits. The name of the object starts with a one-syllable sound made up of a consonant, a vowel and another consonant."
